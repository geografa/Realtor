			<p class="italic text">Karim is wonderful! We immediately felt comfortable with him as well as confident that we would find a house. Karim gave us insight about house structure & systems and the ins and outs of what we could expect if we bought the house because of his previous experience as a contractor. He never tried to "sell" us on a house and we knew he truly wanted us to find the perfect house. He not only organized everything but went above and beyond what was expected while keeping us informed through the entire process. - Very happy 1st time home buyers :)</p>

			<p class="italic text">I found the entire process of working together with Karim and Leonie easy, synergistic, exciting and natural. From beginning to end we were partners and I was truly invigorated to sell my beloved home. We set out our goals to have the house sale ready within 30 days and to sell in a desired price range and close by the end of the following 30 days, and that is exactly what happened! I could not have imagined a more enjoyable journey and am so very grateful to have worked with two such positive, helpful and supportive people.</p>

			<p class="italic text">Having had a previous experience with another realtor, we were amazed at how different and how much better our experience with Karim was. He demystified the home-buying process for us, answering questions we didn’t even know we had and taking care of so many of the small and large steps involved, all of which reduced our anxiety considerably and made the whole endeavor very seamless. We fully trusted that Karim always had our best interest in mind.
			He advocated for us, offered us sound guidance, respected our decisions while also offering caution when necessary, referred us to other skilled professionals, and ultimately found us a fantastic house. We are so pleased to have worked with Karim, and we continue to recommend him to others.</p>

			<p class="italic text">We were fortunate that a family member referred Karim to be one of five realtors we interviewed for this journey of selling our first home and buying our “dream home.” We finally found our dream home but attached was a difficult seller, that Karim handled wonderfully. He took great care of us through our transactions, making our journey a positive experience from beginning to end. THANK YOU KARIM!</p>

			<p class="italic text">What we loved about working with Leonie and Karim was their high level of professionalism, dependability, and knowledge. Walking through a house with Karim is like having a contractor, carpenter, painter, plumber and electrician all in one. As a result, we knew exactly what we were getting into when we purchased our home and felt totally comfortable about the big investment we were making.</p>

			<p class="italic text">Karim and Leonie made the effort to understand what was important to us in a home property. This wasn't them just putting us in a box they had seen a hundred times before. They continually worked to understand the large features and subtle details that ensnared our passions.</p>
			<p class="italic text">Karim's experience in renovation helped us talk through the possibilities and options within each property and, critically, helped us see potential challenges we might not have predicted on our own.</p>
			<p class="italic text">Although the process of buying a house can be intimidating and stressful, Karim and Leonie made it fun. We looked forward to every session, knowing we were always on the brink of finding a house that we could make perfect for us.</p>

			<p class="italic text">I had a wonderful experience working with Karim and Leonie and happily recommend them to anyone looking to buy or sell their home. My 70-year-old parents moved from across the country to retire in Portland and hoped to find a home to fit their very specific needs. It was immediately apparent that Karim and Leonie were up to the challenge; not only did they understand my parents' needs, but they anticipated them. With patience and enthusiasm, Karim and Leonie helped us navigate the Portland real estate market and found my parents a home that exceeded our expectations. They operate their business with a high level of competence and integrity, and genuinely want their clients to be satisfied. By the time the home was purchased, Karim and Leonie felt like family. We could not have asked for better service, and to this day, they continue to be a valuable resource for all things Portland.</p>

			<p class="italic text">This whole journey spoke loudly of Karim and Leonie’s personalities. They truly care for their clients, and their main mission is to see their clients proud and happy in their new home. We are not the easiest clients... and we will recommend Karim and Leonie for their superb communication skills, patience and general interest in what the client wants & needs.

			<p class="italic text">Dear Karim,<br /><br /> Here I am in our own cool sweet cottage. It’s in a vibrant district, close
			enough to everything yet in a charming well-kept neighborhood. We even have off-street parking and a yard, parks nearby, library, bank, grocery, coffee, restaurants, book stores, you name it.<br /><br />
			I’ve bought and sold a few times before, even with people who were good realtors, who were responsive and stayed in touch. But Karim, you really put them in the shade. I’ve often wondered about the whole project and marveled at how you made it look pretty easy, busy as I know you were. You were quick without ever seeming rushed, always returned calls and email quickly, were unfailingly good humored, helpful, confident, and really competent, with lots of good contacts. These are things I appreciated while trying to buy a place and make as few mistakes as possible.<br /><br />
			As you recall, my daughter and I also worked hard on this project sifting the multiple listings, making priority lists, driving through neighborhoods. You immediately got us in to see what we wanted. I do feel that we accomplished enough shopping to feel confident in our choice when we got to it. Of course, properties all have their pros and cons, and you periodically asked us to state what was most important as we saw actual locations. Your phone calls, often initiated in the moment, to professionals in the building trades got us good ideas of what various problems might cost. Moreover, because of your own background in the building trades it was great to have you there also checking out basements and foundations.<br /><br />
			Last and definitely not least, you did a great job of “wrangling” the whole project. You were handy with contract and financing details when I could use the help. You got me a really thorough inspection report that I continue to use. I have ended up, after the sale, with the list, from your notes, of names and phone numbers of professionals and in some cases written bids for work I want done on the house. I also have your assurance to be of any help you can. I love it. I’m convinced that without your information and	timing I would have missed out on this house. You just worked so hard all the time! And you never let any detail, any question, any concern go un-addressed. Thank you. It was a lot of work but well worth it. I have to tell you, I had fun. I always recommend you where ever I go.<br /><br />
			Thank you. - Cully</p>

			<p class="italic text">From our initial interview with Karim, my fears of working with a realtor dissipated. He spent nearly an hour and a half explaining to us the process of house hunting; talked us through terms that we had never fully understood; and wanted to ensure that he was confident in knowing exactly what we were looking for in a house. We left that meeting with a sense of security and optimism at our soon-to-be working relationship.<br /><br />
				Each meeting with Karim was similar, and we drove far and wide looking at heaps of realty stinkers. When we walked into the house on which we knew we would bid, Karim took action. He coordinated more inspectors than I knew were necessary to confirm we weren't going to buy a lemon - something that I know many realtors do not do for their clients. I have heard horror stories of new homeowners with sewers that erupted soon after they bought - they never had a sewer scan ordered by their realtor. I have heard of people almost falling through their plywood-tiled show- ers, as the inspectors weren't very attentive, etc, etc. Karim surrounds himself with a good, proactive and punctual team.<br /><br />
				Karim stopped by after we had moved into our house with a couple bottles of wine and a lovely card. His attention to detail is outdone only by his personal touches. I am trying to push more of my friends into buy- ing their first homes so I can recommend Karim!
