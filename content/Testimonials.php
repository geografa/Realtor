					<p class="italic text">I found the entire process of working together with Karim and Leonie easy, synergistic, exciting and natural. From beginning to end we were partners and I was truly invigorated to sell my beloved home. We set out our goals to have the house sale ready within 30 days and to sell in a desired price range and close by the end of the following 30 days, and that is exactly what happened! I could not have imagined a more enjoyable journey and am so very grateful to have worked with two such positive, helpful and supportive people.</p>
