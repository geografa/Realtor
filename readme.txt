Hey Rafa…

Major, broad reaction:
LOVE!
 
Minutia as follows:
 
COLOR: I’d like to look at either darker, or blues, or… maybe just a couple of other choices and we can narrow it down pretty quickly. Brown is cool, but I don’t relate to this one…
 
FISRT: I’d like to change it to KarimAndLeonie.com… and just have Talktokarim feed to it…
 
HOME: I like this page a lot…more photos of course… but really good landing page.
 
ABOUT: We need a new photo, of both of us… The something that says: Karim is your realtor… your front man.

An idea is to have the first photo be of both of us… then a 2nd “realtor” photo and text. Your thoughts on this?
 
And for the text, I made a couple of changes:
As a Realtor working in Portland, I have created this site as a resource for buyers & sellers who want to be proactive and well informed about the current market. If you are interested in buying or selling, please Sign Up To Receive A Daily Listing Email. CLICK HERE. (( and I’d like to make that a click-through to LISTING page. )) I look forward to talking with you about houses.
Karim & Leonie are parents of 2 boys, SE Portland residents and world travelers... We are very lucky to have family to visit all over the world. We've recently traveled to England, Scotland, Australia, France, Senegal... all to visit close family.
TESTIMONIALS:
Generally, I like this a lot…
So, intro text could be: We are so grateful for the referrals from past clients. We hope to earn your referrals as well. Here is a sampling of what the Best Clients In The World are saying about working with us.
Photos on the Testimonials page should all be front shots I think… Cute Portland Bungalows mostly. I’ll get these, too.
 
LISTINGS:
I think it should also say (just after the intro sentence) “ You will start getting these Daily Emails tomorrow, and you will never be spammed from this source… (( or something like that. ))
 
CONTACT:
 
This page is good. The map will be a linked, local map for the office I presume?
Instead of “Direct Line,” Let’s say “Karim’s Mobile Phone.”
 
 
IN GENERAL: Heading & subheadings ideas as follows:
HEADING: Karim & Leonie
HOME: Home at last.
ABOUT: Realtors.
TESTIMONIALS: They’re home.
LISTINGS: House hunting made fun.
CONTACT: Hollah at ya! (haven’t sorted this one out yet…
 
 
OK. Leonie… ideas?
 
Rafa, this is awesome.
